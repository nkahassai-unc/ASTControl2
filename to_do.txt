AST Control To Do (1.X)
Web Design Critiques:
- connect weather_monitor with track_sun (soon)

- finish file_handler
    - ensure new files go to preprocessing folder
    - tbd

- investigate startup_mount sync 
    - home position
    - shut down procedure to start up consistent
    - re: startup_mount and new home

- print statements at boot & shut down
    - where? redundant

- static terminal boxes, too wide

*-*-*-*-*-*-
AST Control To Do (1.5.6)

- investigate sync in startup_mount
    - fix home coordinates formatting !
    - fix sync method & when to turn off tracking
    
- investigate tracking in track_sun
    - fix sun coordinates formatting
    - intial_slew()
    - update_sun()
    
- investigate sync & position in shutdown_mount
    - fix home coordinates formatting

- fine report weather_monitor
    - later

--------
Signalling:
- connect weather_monitor signalling to track_sun
    - define, redundant?

- feed webcam data into frame. 
- feed firecapture screen output into another frame.

- update nstep controls 
    - to what? nstep revamped to buttons to javascript

- update etalon controls
    - to what? arduino bindings to python?
    - arduino host on python
    - servo A and servo B, numerical increment
